# XCF MCP Organization Summary

## New Organization (No Extensions!)

The codebase has been reorganized into focused, single-responsibility classes without using Swift extensions.

### File Structure

1. **`XcfMcpServer.swift`** - Core server setup and initialization
2. **`XcfMcpTools.swift`** - All tool definitions (30+ tools)
3. **`XcfMcpResources.swift`** - All resource definitions (10 resources)
4. **`XcfMcpPrompts.swift`** - All prompt definitions (20+ prompts)
5. **`XcfMcpHandlers.swift`** - Main handler registration and utility methods
6. **`XcfMcpToolCallHandlers.swift`** - Main tool call router and core tool handlers
7. **`XcfMcpResourceHandlers.swift`** - Resource request handlers (Xcode projects, build results, file contents)
8. **`XcfMcpPromptHandlers.swift`** - Prompt request handlers (build, run, analyze code)
9. **`XcfMcpHelpHandlers.swift`** - Help and documentation tool handlers
10. **`XcfMcpFileSystemHandlers.swift`** - File system operation handlers
11. **`XcfMcpXcodeDocumentHandlers.swift`** - Xcode document operation handlers
12. **`XcfMcpCodeAnalysisHandlers.swift`** - Code snippet and analyzer handlers
13. **`XcfMcpCodeSnippetHandlers.swift`** - Code snippet extraction and analysis
14. **`XcfMcpDiffHandlers.swift`** - Diff creation and application handlers
15. **`XcfMcpActionHandlers.swift`** - Action-specific tool handlers (project, environment, etc.)
16. **`XcfMcpDefinitions.swift`** - Simple coordinator that delegates to specialized classes
17. **`XcfMcpCollections.swift`** - Legacy compatibility layer (can be removed later)
18. **`XcfMcpConfig.swift`** - MCP-specific configuration constants
19. **`XcfMcpStructStrings.swift`** - String constants and message structs

### Benefits of This Organization

- **No Extensions**: Uses plain classes with static methods
- **Single Responsibility**: Each file has one clear purpose
- **Easy to Find**: Tools, resources, prompts, and handlers are in separate files by category
- **Maintainable**: Adding new functionality is straightforward
- **Clean Dependencies**: Clear hierarchy and delegation patterns
- **Focused Files**: Each handler file focuses on one type of functionality
- **Separated Constants**: String constants are now in their own dedicated file
- **Complete Separation**: Resources and prompts have their own dedicated handler files

- **New Help Handler**: Add to `XcfMcpHelpHandlers.swift`
- **New File System Handler**: Add to `XcfMcpFileSystemHandlers.swift`
- **New Xcode Document Handler**: Add to `XcfMcpXcodeDocumentHandlers.swift`
- **New Code Analysis Handler**: Add to `XcfMcpCodeAnalysisHandlers.swift`
- **New Code Snippet Handler**: Add to `XcfMcpCodeSnippetHandlers.swift`

- **New Prompt Handler**: Add to `XcfMcpPromptHandlers.swift`
- **New MCP Config**: Add to `XcfMcpConfig.swift`
- **New String Constant**: Add to `XcfMcpStructStrings.swift`

### Handler Categories

The handlers are now organized into logical categories:

- **`XcfMcpHelpHandlers.swift`**: Help, documentation, and reference tools
- **`XcfMcpFileSystemHandlers.swift`**: File reading, directory operations
- **`XcfMcpXcodeDocumentHandlers.swift`**: Xcode document management (open, create, read, save, close)
- **`XcfMcpCodeAnalysisHandlers.swift`**: Code snippet and analyzer tool coordination
- **`XcfMcpCodeSnippetHandlers.swift`**: Code extraction and analysis logic
- **`XcfMcpDiffHandlers.swift`**: Diff creation and application
- **`XcfMcpActionHandlers.swift`**: Action-specific tools (project management, environment, build, run)
- **`XcfMcpResourceHandlers.swift`**: Resource operations (Xcode projects, build results, file contents)
- **`XcfMcpPromptHandlers.swift`**: Prompt processing (build, run, analyze code prompts)

### Configuration and Constants

The configuration is now properly separated:

- **`XcfMcpConfig.swift`**: MCP-specific configuration (tools, resources, prompts, schema definitions)
- **`XcfMcpStructStrings.swift`**: String constants (error messages, success messages, app constants, actions, paths, format, Xcode constants)

### Migration Notes

The old extension-based files have been removed and replaced with this focused structure:
- ~~`XcfMcpToolCall.swift`~~ → split into multiple specialized handler files
- ~~`XcfMcpRegistration.swift`~~ → merged into `XcfMcpHandlers.swift`
- ~~`XcfMcpToolParams.swift`~~ → split into `XcfMcpTools.swift`

Individual tool handlers are now distributed across focused files by functionality, and constants are properly separated by purpose. The codebase now has **19 perfectly organized files** with complete separation of concerns, making it much easier to navigate and maintain!
