Speed up writing Xcode apps with xcf, a dead simple Swift-based MCP server specifically designed for Cursor. Works seamlessly with VSCode and Claude, with no TypeScript, no JavaScript, no BS!

## üß∞ XCF Installation & Configuration

### Installation Steps

1. Download the XCF application and drag it to your /Applications folder.
2. Launch the application to approve the internet download.

4. You will see the following alert (this is expected):

<img width="414" alt="XCF Alert" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e84c4ed5-2e17-4064-8871-b35f07af20e8" />

6. Click the "Press to Quit this XCF Xcode MCP Server" button.

> üí° **Troubleshooting:** If XCF doesn't display the alert, run this command:
> ```bash
> codesign --force --deep --sign - /Applications/xcf.app
> ```

You can also build xcf from source using Xcode. It's 100% Swift and easy to build locally.

## üîß Quick Setup

### Minimum Requirements:

Add xcf to your MCP configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "xcf": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/Applications/xcf.app/Contents/MacOS/xcf server"
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuration Locations
- **Cursor**: `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
- **Claude Desktop**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Restart your AI assistant after setup or refresh the tool.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Configuration

For non-Cursor clients or users requiring project-level control:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "xcf": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "/Applications/xcf.app/Contents/MacOS/xcf server",
      "env": {
          "XCODE_PROJECT_FOLDER": "/path/to/project/",
          "XCODE_PROJECT": "/path/to/project/project.xcodeproj"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

These environment variables let you:
- Pre-select a specific Xcode project to work with
- Define a custom workspace boundary for security

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Zero Dependencies:** Easy to install, no reliance on other MCP servers
- **Automatic Project Detection:** Auto-selects your Xcode project so you can start coding immediately
- **Real-time Error Handling:** `xcf build` or `xcf run` sends errors and warnings from Xcode directly to your AI IDE
- **AI-Powered Fixes:** Let Claude fix bugs and mistakes during your coding sessions
- **Intuitive Commands:** Simple, developer-friendly command structure for maximum productivity

## üõ†Ô∏è Perfect for Swift Developers

The tool is designed by Swift developers, for Swift developers. Commands like `build`, `run`, and `show` make the workflow intuitive and natural.

## üìã Commands Reference

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `use xcf` | Activate xcf mode |
| `show` | List open Xcode projects |
| `open #` | Select project by number |
| `run` | Run current project |
| `build` | Build current project |
| `current` | Show selected project |
| `env` | Show environment variables |
| `pwd` | Show current folder (aliases: dir, path) |
| `help` | Display all available commands |

## üìÑ Using Snippets

### For Human Commands

xcf supports simplified, user-friendly snippet commands:

To get an entire file, just use the filename:
```
xcf snippet filename.swift
```

No need for full paths in many cases - xcf will intelligently find and display the complete file contents.

For specific line ranges:
```
xcf snippet filename.swift 10 20
```

You can use either format for file operations:

```
xcf snippet /path/to/file.swift                 // Direct path
xcf snippet filePath=/path/to/file.swift        // Named parameter

xcf analyze /path/to/file.swift                 // Direct path
xcf analyze filePath=/path/to/file.swift        // Named parameter

xcf lz /path/to/file.swift                      // Direct path (shorthand)
xcf lz filePath=/path/to/file.swift             // Named parameter (shorthand)
```

For specific line ranges:
```
xcf snippet /path/to/file.swift 10 20           // Direct path with line range
xcf snippet filePath=/path/to/file.swift startLine=10 endLine=20  // Named parameters
```

### For AI Assistants

When using xcf through MCP tools, use this syntax:

```
mcp_xcf_snippet filePath="filename.swift" entireFile=true
```

For specific line ranges:
```
mcp_xcf_snippet filePath="filename.swift" startLine=10 endLine=20
```

### Smart Path Resolution

When a file isn't found at the exact path, xcf will intelligently search for it in:

1. First tries the exact path provided
2. Resolves relative paths using the current working directory
3. Searches in the current project directory and one level up
4. Searches in the workspace folder defined by WORKSPACE_FOLDER_PATHS
5. Searches recursively in workspace folders with limited depth
6. As a last resort, performs a fuzzy search for similar filenames

This smart path resolution is used consistently across ALL file operations in xcf, including:
- File reading and writing
- Code snippets and analysis
- Directory operations
- File editing and deletion
- Document operations in Xcode

This means you can usually just use the filename without any path for any operation:

```
xcf snippet Constants.swift    // For humans
xcf analyze Constants.swift    // For humans
xcf edit Constants.swift       // For humans
```

Or for AI assistants:

```
mcp_xcf_snippet filePath="Constants.swift" entireFile=true
mcp_xcf_analyzer filePath="Constants.swift" entireFile=true
mcp_xcf_xcf action="edit Constants.swift"
```

## üîç Swift Code Analysis

### For Human Commands

Analyze an entire Swift file for potential issues:
```
xcf analyze filename.swift
```

Or use the shorthand version:
```
xcf lz filename.swift
```

For specific line ranges:
```
xcf analyze filename.swift --startLine 10 --endLine 50
```

### For AI Assistants

When using xcf through MCP tools, use this syntax:

```
mcp_xcf_analyzer filePath="filename.swift" entireFile=true
```

Or use the shorthand version:
```
mcp_xcf_xcf action="lz filename.swift"
```

For specific line ranges:
```
mcp_xcf_analyzer filePath="filename.swift" startLine=10 endLine=50
```

The analysis identifies issues like:
- Code style and formatting problems
- Functions with high complexity
- Unused variables and symbols
- Magic numbers
- Long methods
- And more

```

```

To analyze an entire file:
```
mcp_xcf_analyzer(filePath="/full/path/to/file.swift", entireFile=true)
